#  RELEVANCE-BASED PRUNING
This is the repository with the implementation of the proposed method: Relevance-Based Pruning proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02154

## MatLab implementation
We offer an implementation of the traditional ELM and the proposed RBP method.
Also, we provide an example of the aplication of RBP in synthetic data.


## Python implementation
We offer a second implementation of the traditional ELM and the proposed RBP method.
The demo offers a step by step example of all the functions implemented.
